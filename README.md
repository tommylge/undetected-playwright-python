# ðŸŽ­ [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for Python 

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/undetected-playwright-patch.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/undetected-playwright-patch)

This is a patch of the original playwright implementation for Python.

It currently passes for sure (tested on Win10):
- âœ… [CloudFare] 
- âœ… [Bet365] (shape//F5 I think)
- [Others] Unknown/Not tested

Warnings: 
* the **Only chromium** part for Playwright is patched.
* This will overwrite your default playwright package.

Note: For testing with Playwright and undetected-playwright, use multiple venv's

## Example

```python
import asyncio

# undetected-playwright here!
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright, Playwright


async def run(playwright: Playwright):
    args = []
    
    # disable navigator.webdriver:true flag
    args.append("--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled")
    browser = await playwright.chromium.launch(channel="chrome", headless=False,
                                               args=args)
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://nowsecure.nl/#relax")
    input("Press ENTER to continue to Creep-JS:")
    await page.goto("https://nowsecure.nl/#relax")
    await page.goto("https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/")
    input("Press ENTER to exit:")
    await browser.close()


async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
        await run(playwright)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.ProactorEventLoop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
    # asyncio.run(main) # should work for non-Windows as well
```

```py

# undetected-playwright here!
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright


with sync_playwright() as p:
    args = []
    
    # disable navigator.webdriver:true flag
    args.append("--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled")
    browser = p.chromium.launch(args=args, headless=False, channel="chrome")
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://nowsecure.nl/#relax")
    input("Press ENTER to continue to Creep-JS:")
    page.goto("https://nowsecure.nl/#relax")
    page.goto("https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/")
    input("Press ENTER to exit:")
    browser.close()
